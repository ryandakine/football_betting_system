## 💡 Strategy for Week 13

### Conservative Approach (Safer)
- Only bet TIER 3+ games
- Require Big Ten/Mountain West home field
- Avoid spreads at -3.5 or -7.5 (miss key numbers)
- Size bets at 1.5% or lower
- Target 60%+ expected confidence from model

### Aggressive Approach (Higher Variance)
- Include TIER 4 games (65% win rate)
- Accept conference games even with slight edges
- Leverage key numbers when available
- Size bets at 1.5-2.0%
- Target 55%+ expected confidence from model

### Recommended Balance
- **50% TIER 3** (1.5% bankroll) - Highest confidence
- **40% TIER 4** (1.2% bankroll) - Secondary plays
- **10% TIER 5** (1.0% bankroll) - Selective spots

Expected combined win rate: 62-65% (good for week 13)
