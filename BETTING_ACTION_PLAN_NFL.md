---

### **Saturday 6:00 PM - Final Line Checks**
**Duration:** 10 minutes
**Task:** Check if lines have moved significantly

**If line moved 2+ points:**

**Lock in final bet amounts for Sunday**

---

### **Sunday 11:00 AM - Place Early Game Bets**
**Window:** 11:00 AM - 12:45 PM
**Games:** 1:00 PM kickoffs (typically 8-10 games)

**Action:**
1. Log in to sportsbook
2. Place bets on games from Top 5 that passed video scouting
3. **Start with smallest bets first** (if nervous)
4. **Verify each bet before confirming** (team, spread, amount)

**Bet sizing:**

- **TIER 2 SUPER EDGE:** 2.0% bankroll ($2.02) [Rare in Week 11]
- **TIER 3 STRONG EDGE:** 1.5% bankroll ($1.52)
- **TIER 4 MODERATE EDGE:** 1.2% bankroll ($1.21)
- **TIER 5 SELECTIVE:** 1.0% bankroll ($1.01)

**After video scouting:**
- **5/5 checks passed:** Bet full tier amount
- **4/5 checks passed:** Bet 70% of tier amount
- **3/5 checks passed:** Bet 50% or skip

---

### **Sunday 3:30 PM - Place Late Game Bets**
**Window:** 3:30 PM - 4:20 PM
**Games:** 4:05 PM and 4:25 PM kickoffs (typically 3-4 games)

**Action:**

4. Stick to your pre-determined bet sizes

---

### **Sunday 7:00 PM - SNF Bet (Optional)**
**Window:** 7:00 PM - 8:15 PM
**Game:** Sunday Night Football (8:20 PM kickoff)

**Action:**
1. Only bet if SNF game was in your Top 5
2. **Do NOT** add SNF as a "catch-up" bet
3. **Do NOT** bet larger to recover early losses

**SNF considerations:**
- Prime time games are harder to predict (lots of variance)
- Sharp bettors focus on SNF (line is efficient)
- Only bet if you have strong edge (TIER 3 or better)

## **🚨 Betting Rules (DO NOT VIOLATE)**

### **Rule 1: Video Scouting is MANDATORY**
- **Do NOT skip video scouting** "because the line is moving"
- **Do NOT bet** on a game you haven't watched film on
- **Do NOT trust** system predictions blindly

**Why:** One injury can drop your 70% bet to a 30% bet.

---

### **Rule 2: Never Chase Losses**
- If you lose early games, **DO NOT** increase late game bet sizes
- If you go 0-2 in early games, **DO NOT** bet 3x on SNF to "get even"
- **Accept small losses** (they're part of the game)

**Why:** Chasing losses turns -$2 into -$10.

---

### **Rule 3: Stick to Tier Sizing**
- **TIER 1:** 2.5% ($2.53) [Almost never available Week 11]
- **TIER 2:** 2.0% ($2.02) [Rare Week 11]
- **TIER 3:** 1.5% ($1.52) [Target 1-2 of these]
- **TIER 4:** 1.2% ($1.21) [Most Week 11 bets]
- **TIER 5:** 1.0% ($1.01) [Skip unless very confident]

**Do NOT** bet 5% on a "sure thing." There are no sure things.

---

### **Rule 4: Maximum 5 Bets Per Week**
- **Do NOT** bet on 8+ games because "they all look good"
- **Quality > Quantity**
- **5 well-researched bets** beat 10 random bets

**Why:** Overexposure = higher variance, harder to recover.

---

### **Rule 5: Circuit Breaker**
- If bankroll drops below $76 (25% drawdown), **STOP BETTING**
- Take a week off, analyze what went wrong
- Do NOT try to "bet your way back"

**Why:** Protecting capital is priority #1.

## **🔥 If Things Go Wrong**

### **Scenario: You go 0-3 in early games (-$4)**

**WRONG Response:**
- ❌ "I need to win it back on SNF" → Bet $8 on SNF
- ❌ "System is broken" → Abandon system
- ❌ "Bad luck" → Bet same way next week

**CORRECT Response:**
- ✅ Accept the loss (-$4 is expected some weeks)
- ✅ Review video scouting (did I miss something?)
- ✅ Stick to plan for next week
- ✅ If 0-3 happens 2 weeks in row → Pause and analyze

**Remember:** Even 60% win rate means 40% losses. Losing weeks happen.
