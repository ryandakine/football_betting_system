# 📺 NFL NARRATIVE TRACKING GUIDE

**Purpose**: Track how the NFL/media frames each team throughout the season (Weeks 1-16 + Playoffs) to identify betting edges that emerge from narrative shifts.

---

## 🎯 The Concept

The NFL has ~3-4 predetermined "Super Bowl favorite" narratives at season start. As the season progresses, teams either:
- **Live up to expectations** (narrative confirmed)
- **Underperform** (narrative questioned, often creates betting opportunity)
- **Overperform** (surprise team narrative emerges)
- **Fade down stretch** (fatigue, injury, motivation drops)

By tracking narratives week-by-week, you can spot when:
1. **Lines haven't caught up to narrative change** = betting opportunity
2. **Team is overvalued based on narrative** = fade opportunity
3. **Narrative shift is about to happen** = get ahead of market

## 📊 8 NFL Narrative Archetypes

### 1. **SUPER BOWL CONTENDER**
- **Story**: Built as clear playoff favorite
- **Markers**: Star QB, high expectations, Vegas favorite, media darling
- **Week 1-4 Behavior**: Usually wins as expected (but lines respect this)
- **Week 8-12 Behavior**: Any stumble creates huge doubt/overreaction
- **Betting Edge**: 
  - OVERVALUED early (lines too high)
  - UNDERVALUED after one bad loss (panic overreaction)
  - Watch for teams that stumble mid-season

**Examples**: Usually 2-3 teams per year (e.g., recent years: Chiefs, 49ers, Eagles)

### 2. **DARK HORSE**
- **Story**: Surprise team outperforming expectations
- **Markers**: Beating Vegas projections, "Cinderella" story, building momentum
- **Week 1-4 Behavior**: Not recognized yet, getting good value
- **Week 8-12 Behavior**: Lines recognize them, value disappears
- **Betting Edge**:
  - EXCELLENT VALUE in weeks 4-8 (Vegas hasn't caught up)
  - OVERVALUED in weeks 10-12 (market overcompensates)

**Examples**: Lions 2023, Vikings this year, etc.

### 3. **DEFENDING CHAMP**
- **Story**: Last year's champion defending title
- **Markers**: Experience advantage, "target on back" narrative, pressure narrative
- **Week 1-4 Behavior**: Often underrated (doubt creeps in)
- **Week 8-12 Behavior**: Either proving critics wrong or fading to pressure
- **Betting Edge**:
  - Usually GOOD VALUE early (lines discount pressure)
  - FADE late if team starts falling (pressure gets to them)

### 4. **REBUILDING**
- **Story**: Young team in development phase
- **Markers**: Young players, development focus, tank possibility
- **Week 1-4 Behavior**: Highly volatile, inconsistent
- **Week 8-12 Behavior**: Either showing improvement or falling apart
- **Betting Edge**:
  - AVOID most weeks (too unpredictable)
  - Only bet when clear pattern emerges
  - Watch for backup QB performances (surprises common)

### 5. **VETERAN GROUP**
- **Story**: Experienced roster chasing ring (now or never)
- **Markers**: Veteran QB, aging stars, "this is our year" narrative
- **Week 1-4 Behavior**: Often overvalued (market respects experience)
- **Week 8-12 Behavior**: Fade risk (physical decline), motivation issues
- **Betting Edge**:
  - FADE late in season (physical decline)
  - Lines don't account for fatigue/injury accumulation
  - Good underdog bets in cold weather games Week 14-16

### 6. **INJURY PLAGUED**
- **Story**: Team dealing with major injuries
- **Markers**: Key players out, backup QB, "season in jeopardy" narrative
- **Week 1-4 Behavior**: Massive line adjustment (usually overcorrection)
- **Week 8-12 Behavior**: Depends on backup performance
- **Betting Edge**:
  - Backups often OUTPERFORM expectations (value on those teams)
  - Main team often UNDERPERFORMS when key players return (line slow to adjust)

### 7. **PLAYOFF BUBBLE**
- **Story**: Fighting for playoff spot
- **Markers**: Close division, "make or miss" games, elevated urgency
- **Week 8-12 Behavior**: High motivation, inconsistent performances
- **Week 13-16 Behavior**: Desperation peaks
- **Betting Edge**:
  - Motivation high but unreliable (inconsistent)
  - FADE spreads (too much variance)
  - Good value on unders (tight games, clock management)

### 8. **DIVISION LEADER**
- **Story**: Controlling division, others chasing
- **Markers**: First place, controlling narrative, controlling destiny
- **Week 1-4 Behavior**: Often overvalued early
- **Week 8-12 Behavior**: "Look ahead" bias (team ahead in division)
- **Betting Edge**:
  - FADE when big lead in division (trap games common)
  - Overconfidence bets by public on division leaders
  - Look for letdowns after big wins

## 🔄 How Narratives Shift Throughout Season

### **Weeks 1-4: Initial Narratives Cement**
- Super Bowl contenders play well, get wins (overvalued)
- Dark horses start emerging but not recognized yet
- Teams underperform expectations face early doubt

**Betting Strategy**: 
- Fade public teams (too loved, lines too high)
- Buy underdog teams (value not yet recognized)

### **Weeks 5-8: Narratives Tested**
- Early surprises confirmed or exposed
- Injuries start changing narratives
- Division races take shape

**Betting Strategy**:
- Dark horses increasingly overvalued (jump on public perception)
- Super Bowl contenders either pulling away or showing chinks
- Look for narrative reversals

### **Weeks 9-12: Narratives Harden**
- Teams basically are what they appear to be
- Playoff implications become concrete
- "Buy-low" windows for Super Bowl contenders starting to close

**Betting Strategy**:
- Fade playoff-desperate teams (unpredictable)
- Focus on clear Super Bowl contenders (most predictable)
- Veterans aging out start to show fatigue

### **Weeks 13-16: Narrative Endgame**
- Super Bowl contenders securing seeds
- Playoff-bound teams thinking ahead
- Eliminated teams checking out

**Betting Strategy**:
- FADE teams with clinched seeds (looking ahead)
- FADE teams eliminated (no motivation)
- BET ON teams fighting for last spot (maximum motivation)

### **Playoffs: Narrative Reset**
- Best-of patterns emerge
- Single-game elimination changes everything
- Veterans' "now or never" narrative peaks

**Betting Strategy**:
- Recency bias huge (last 4 weeks very important)
- Matchup narratives (not season narratives) matter
- Rest advantage can flip narratives
