## 🎬 Video Scouting Integration

**Your system has video editions of upcoming games. This is your competitive edge.**

### Pre-Week Video Analysis
1. **Monday**: Watch video editions of upcoming week's top matchups
2. **Identify**: Soft spots, team chemistry, key player conditions
3. **Document**: Findings in prediction notes
4. **Apply**: To model predictions Thursday

### Weeks 12-15 Video Priorities
- **W12**: Motivation levels for bowl eligibility desperate teams
- **W13**: Conference title race seriousness + rivalry effects
- **W14**: CCG preparation (are starters being rested?)
- **W15**: Transfer portal exodus + motivation assessment

### NFL Narrative Video Scouting
- Look for narrative markers: confidence, urgency, focus
- Spot resting/not-ready-to-play situations
- Assess veteran fatigue levels
- Watch for injury affects on backup performance
