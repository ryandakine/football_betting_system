# 📹 NFL VIDEO SCOUTING CHECKLIST
**CRITICAL: Do NOT place bets without video confirmation!**

## Why Video Scouting Matters

Your system can be 70% accurate based on stats alone. But **video scouting prevents catastrophic losses**:

- ❌ **Without video:** Bet on team with star QB... who got injured Tuesday (not in system yet)
- ✅ **With video:** See backup QB struggled last 3 games → SKIP BET
- **Result:** Saved $2-5 loss

**5-10 minutes of video per game can save you 1-2 bad bets per week.**

## 🎯 Pre-Bet Video Scouting Protocol

For each game in your **Top 5 bets**, complete this checklist:

### Game: __________________ (Fill in)

---

### 1. Team Injury Status (YouTube: "[Team] injury report this week")

**Home Team:**
- [ ] **Starting QB healthy?** (If backup, SKIP unless system accounts for it)
- [ ] **Top 2 WRs available?** (No star WRs = 10-15% confidence drop)
- [ ] **Offensive line intact?** (3+ injured linemen = SKIP)
- [ ] **Defensive stars out?** (Check for suspensions/injuries)

**Away Team:**
- [ ] Same checks as above

**Decision:**
- ✅ **Both teams match system assumptions** → Proceed
- ⚠️  **Minor injuries (1-2 role players)** → Reduce bet 30-50%
- ❌ **Major injury (QB, 2+ starters)** → **SKIP BET**

---

### 2. Recent Form Check (YouTube: "[Team] highlights last 3 games")

**Home Team Last 3 Games:**
- Game 1 (Week ___): W/L? ___  Offense looked: Good / Okay / Bad
- Game 2 (Week ___): W/L? ___  Defense looked: Good / Okay / Bad
- Game 3 (Week ___): W/L? ___  Special teams: Good / Okay / Bad

**Away Team Last 3 Games:**
- Same as above

**Red Flags** (Any of these = REDUCE or SKIP):
- [ ] Team on 3+ game losing streak (morale issue)
- [ ] Blowout losses (20+ points) in 2 of last 3 games
- [ ] Offense averaging < 14 points last 3 games
- [ ] Defense allowing 35+ points consistently

**Decision:**
- ✅ **Form matches system expectations** → Proceed
- ⚠️  **Form slightly worse** → Reduce bet 20-30%
- ❌ **Form way off** → **SKIP BET**

---

### 3. Weather Check (Weather.com for game location)

- [ ] Precipitation: Rain / Snow / None
- [ ] Field conditions: Dome / Outdoor / Retractable roof

**Weather Adjustments:**
- **Wind 20+ mph:** Favor UNDER total, avoid passing-heavy teams
- **Rain/Snow:** Favor home team (+5-10%), UNDER total

- **Perfect conditions:** No adjustment

**Decision:**
- ✅ **Weather matches system or favors your bet** → Proceed
- ⚠️  **Weather neutral** → No adjustment

**Referee Red Flags:**

**Decision:**

---

### 5. Line Movement Check (OddsPortal.com or similar)

**Opening Line:** ___
**Current Line:** ___
**Movement:** Moved toward Home / Away / No change

**Sharp Money Indicators:**

## ⚡ Speed Scouting (If Time-Limited)

**Can't watch 3 full games? Do this minimum:**

1. **Watch last game only** (10 min highlights)
2. **Check injury report** (2 min on Twitter/NFL.com)
3. **Check weather** (1 min)
4. **Total time:** 15 minutes per game

**For Top 5 bets = 75 minutes total**

**This is non-negotiable. 75 minutes of scouting can save you $10-20 in bad bets.**

---

## 🚨 Auto-Skip Situations (No Video Needed)

**ALWAYS skip these bets, regardless of system confidence:**

1. **Backup QB making first start** (unless system specifically accounts for it)
2. **3+ key injuries on one team** (OL, QB, top 2 WRs)
3. **Weather: 25+ mph winds** for passing-heavy teams
4. **Line moved 4+ points against you** since opening
5. **Team eliminated from playoffs** playing against playoff contender
6. **Short week (Thursday)** for team coming off Sunday game
7. **Cross-country road trip** (West coast team at East coast 1 PM game)

---

## 📈 Expected Results

**Without Video Scouting:**
- Win rate: 52-55% (system alone)
- Bad bets: 2-3 per week
- Weekly loss potential: $3-6

**With Video Scouting:**
- Win rate: 58-62% (system + video confirmation)
- Bad bets: 0-1 per week
- Weekly loss potential: $0-2

**Time investment:** 75 minutes per week
**Expected value:** +$4-8 profit vs without scouting
