## 📋 What to Look For When Betting Week 15

### ✅ Positive Indicators (Bet With Confidence)
- Home team in Big Ten/Mountain West (strong home field)
- Ranked team with clear motivation (bowl eligibility/playoff)
- Non-conference mismatch (if any exist week 15)
- Key players confirmed available
- Home team with 3+ points and likely to be undervalued

### ⚠️ Red Flags (Proceed With Caution)
- Pac-12 home teams (weak home field - fade)
- Late season rest situations (check news)
- Team eliminated from contention (motivation issue)
- Multiple key injuries
- Spread at key number (-3.5, -7.5) working against you

### 🔍 Additional Research Needed
- Team bowl eligibility status (coming into week 15)
- Playoff implications (if still active for top teams)
- Transfer portal activity (players sitting out)
- Coaching staff updates
- Recent injury reports

## 💡 Strategy for Week 15

### Conservative Approach (Safer)
- Only bet TIER 3+ games
- Require Big Ten/Mountain West home field
- Avoid spreads at -3.5 or -7.5 (miss key numbers)
- Size bets at 1.5% or lower
- Target 60%+ expected confidence from model

### Aggressive Approach (Higher Variance)
- Include TIER 4 games (65% win rate)
- Accept conference games even with slight edges
- Leverage key numbers when available
- Size bets at 1.5-2.0%
- Target 55%+ expected confidence from model

### Recommended Balance
- **50% TIER 3** (1.5% bankroll) - Highest confidence
- **40% TIER 4** (1.2% bankroll) - Secondary plays
- **10% TIER 5** (1.0% bankroll) - Selective spots

Expected combined win rate: 62-65% (good for week 15)

**Expected ROI**: Realistic 5-10% (sustainable late-season profit)
