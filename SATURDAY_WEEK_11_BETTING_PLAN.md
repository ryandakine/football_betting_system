## 🧠 WORLD MODEL UNDERSTANDING

### Early Season (Weeks 1-2):
```
Power 5 Home Team
    ↓
Schedules Cupcake Opponent (FCS, weak G5)
    ↓
Massive Talent Gap (+3-4 star recruit difference)
    ↓  
Home Crowd Energized (season opener)
    ↓
Blowout: 88% win rate, +27 point margin
```

### Late Season (Weeks 8-11):
```
Conference Home Team
    ↓
Plays Division Rival (scouted all year)
    ↓
Similar Talent Levels (recruiting within conference)
    ↓
Motivation Equalizes (bowl eligibility, rankings)
    ↓
Competitive: 56% win rate, +2.4 point margin
```

## 📈 Adjusted Expectations for Week 11

**DON'T EXPECT:**
- 70% win rate (that was early season games)
- +20 point blowouts
- 10+ strong picks per weekend
- Mega edges everywhere

**DO EXPECT:**  
- 55-60% win rate (still profitable!)
- Close games (3-7 point margins)
- 3-5 quality picks per weekend
- Smaller edges, smaller bets

**This is NORMAL and GOOD**

At 55-60% you still beat Vegas and make money.

## 💡 KEY INSIGHT

Your system works, but it's **situational**:

**Early Season (Weeks 1-2):**
- Bet heavy (2-3% per game)
- Expect 75-85% win rate
- Load up on Power 5 home non-conference

**Mid Season (Weeks 3-7):**
- Bet normal (1-2% per game)
- Expect 60-70% win rate
- Focus on conference home fields

**Late Season (Weeks 8-12):**
- Bet light (0.5-1.5% per game)
- Expect 55-60% win rate
- Be selective, need other edges (injuries, weather, etc.)

## 🎯 ACTION PLAN FOR SATURDAY

1. **Run your actual predictions** for all Saturday games
2. **Use edge selector** to score each game
3. **Filter to 60%+ final confidence** only
4. **Pick 3-5 best games** (not all 50+)
5. **Bet smaller** than you would early season
6. **Track results** to validate 55-60% rate

**Expected Saturday:**
- Bets: 3-5 games
- Risk: $4-8 total
- Win rate: 55-60%
- Profit: $1-3

**Over 6 weeks of late season:**
- Total bets: 20-30
- Total risk: $25-40
- Total profit: $8-15

**Combined with NFL** you can hit your $60 goal IF you add more capital or hit higher end of variance.

## 🚀 TO USE YOUR ACTUAL PREDICTIONS:

```bash
# If you have prediction_log.json with Saturday's games:
python /mnt/user-data/outputs/edge_based_bet_selector.py prediction_log.json

# It will show you which games have best edges
# And adjust confidence based on week 11 patterns
```

**Bottom line:** Your system is legit, but Week 11 won't give you 70%. Expect 55-60% and bet accordingly.
